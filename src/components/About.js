      <h2>A little more about me...</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Tomek Regulski - I am a full-stack developer based in
        Manhattan. In addition to recently completing a coding bootcamp at
        Columbia University, I have 7+ years experience in CPG, and 10+ years
        experience in the performing arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am passionate about using my newly-developed skills in responsive web
        design, Javascript, SQL, and React to build apps that provide elegant
        and intuitive solutions to the task at hand - whether it be business
        operations, connecting with like-minded people, or discovering a new
        park to explore.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, there is a good chance that I am working on my
        music, out for a stroll, or trying out a new recipe in the kitchen.
