      <h2>A little more about me...</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Tomek Regulski - I am a full-stack developer based in
        Manhattan. In addition to my progamming work, I have 7+ years experience
        in CPG, and 10+ years experience in the performing arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am passionate about building elegant and intuitive solutions to the
        task at hand - whether it be optimizing workflow, connecting with an
        audience, or discovering a new park to explore. Some of the tools that I
        use include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and React.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am equally at home in front and back end development, and love taking
        the journery from abstract idea to practical execution. If you have a
        project in mind, or simply want to inquire further - please get in touch
        through any of the methods below, and let's chat soon!
