      <h2>A little more about me...</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Tomek Regulski - I am a full-stack developer based in
        Manhattan. In addition to my programming work, I have 7+ years
        experience in CPG, and 10+ years experience in the performing arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am passionate about building elegant and intuitive solutions to the
        task at hand - whether it be optimizing workflow, connecting with an
        audience, or exploring a hobby. Some of the tools that I use include
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MySQL, MongoDB, React, Heroku, and
        Material-UI.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am equally at home in front and back end development, and love taking
        the journey from abstract idea to practical execution. If you have a
        project in mind, or simply want to inquire further - get in touch and
        let's chat soon!
